    What moved us to choose this topic


    </li>


    Markus and I are both very interested in mopeds and tuning. We are passionate about it and therefore it was obvious to set up such a site.

       What should our website do?

    </li>

    Our site will be a kind of parts flea market where you can offer and sell your moped parts. You can add photos and short descriptions as well as prices, which can be viewed by other users.
